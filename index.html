        <h2>ADVOCACY</h2>
        <p>Here are the reason why i advocate them:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
            <li><strong>TEACHING THE YOUTH</strong>: Teaching the youth for them to be educated that education is important in their generation, Because i bealive that teaching them early in academics will motivate them until they graduate, Having this kind of Advocacy will make many childrens will know the importance of education.</li>
            <li><strong>GENDER EQUALITY</strong>: Gender Equality is one of the problems in our country (Philippines), we should know the problems between a man and women, Few men said that women should just take care of their babies and not work because thats their job, and thats their only job as a women, But i believe that many women can do what they want and can work however the job is, and by that our world will live in peace and have equality especially to the LGBTQIA+ Community.</li>
